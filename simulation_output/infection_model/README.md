Based on the parameters provided in parameters_and_models/infection_model each experiment folder provides 250 simulation results of the respective parameter setting for the infection model.

The simulation result for 1 simulation contains:
* the console output
* the location mapping
* the infection paths of the agents
* and the output containing information about the agents location and infection state for each simulation time step
